# Movie Time ft Peta
This is another simple React Native app per a Pluralsight course by Richard Monson-Hafael on Building Mobile Apps with React Native. There may be some differences here from the actual course's. To use these files:

Ideally, go over the course but...you can:

1. Install expo on your machine: `npm i -g expo expo-cli`
2. Create a template expo React Native app: Run `expo init MovieTime`
3. Update the template app's files with the ones in this repo
4. Install the app's dependencies: Run `npm i`
5. Open an emulator/simulator or have your device ready
6. Run the app using expo: `expo start`
7. In the relevant browser window, select the Android emulator or iOS Simulator to see it in action.
